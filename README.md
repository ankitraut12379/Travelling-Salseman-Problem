# Travelling-Salseman-Problem
Ant Colony Optimization of Travelling Salseman Problem

Goal of this project was to optimise the Travelling Salseman Problem by applying Genetic algorithm.

Based on this research paper ( IEEE - TSP Solution Based on the Ant Colony Algorithm ) https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6643172 this implementation try to imitate natural ants and thus find the shortest path from one city to another using level of pheromone on the path.

We have kept a lot of scope of randomness in the algorithm and taken minimum distance out of each path of every ant in all iterations.

It is easy to implement if we follow the paper along with some other resources.
